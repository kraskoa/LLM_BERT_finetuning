# LLM_25L_projekt

This repository contains a project I've done for a university course about LLMs. The main objective was to compare the quality of multiclass classification between a fine-tuned LLM and a "classical" classifier model from the scikit-learn library. All of the code is conveniently written in Jupyter notebooks.
